## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This repo contains firmware and configuration instructions for PickCounter Projects

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
- Arduino IDE
- A PC with python3 installed
```

### Installing <a name = "installing"></a>

A step by step series that tell you how to get the Firmware and Backend running

#### ESP32 Configuration

You should have Arduino IDE Installed

  1.  Add ESP32 Board to your Arduino IDE
    1. In your Arduino IDE, go to File> Preferences
        Installing ESP32 Add-on in Arduino IDE Windows, Mac OS X, Linux open preferences
    2. Enter ```https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json``` 
        into the ‚ÄúAdditional Board Manager URLs‚Äù field then, click the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù button:
    Note: if you already have the ESP32 boards URL, you can separate the URLs with a comma as follows:
    ```https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json,
      http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json```
    1. Open the Boards Manager. Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager‚Ä¶
    2. Search for ESP32 and press install button for the ESP32 by Espressif Systems‚Äú:
    3. That‚Äôs it. It should be installed after a few seconds.

  2.  Now copy the contents of the libs folder to the libraries directory of your Arduino
    4. If you are using windows, the libraries directory will be Documents/Arduino/libraries

##### ESP32 Node FW Uploading
  1.  Select ESP32 Dev Module from Tools->Board->ESP32
  2.  Select the correct port from Tools->Port
  3.  Then open ESP32Firmware.ino file, and open WiFiCreds.h tab on line number 4 and 5, put your WiFi creds
  4.  Upload the Code to your ESP32 Wrover Module Gateway Board
  5.  Open the serial monitor and press reset button of your ESP32.
  6.  You will get Device ID on serial monitor, note it down as you will be using it in Python Script to send data.




## üéà PythonScript Configuration <a name="pythonscript"></a>

1.  Download and install Python3 from official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2.  Go in the PythonScript folder and open the terminal
3.  Execute ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
### Running Python Script

- Run the python script using ```python3 Script.py```
- The script will start running. You can add orders to the Spreadsheet and they will be instantly dispached to the ESP32 devices. Once the ESP32 completes an order, it will be removed form the sheet and the next order will be sent.
