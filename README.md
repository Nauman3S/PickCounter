## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This repo contains firmware and configuration instructions for PickCounter Projects

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
- Arduino IDE
- A PC with python3 installed
```

### Installing <a name = "installing"></a>

A step by step series that tell you how to get the Firmware and Backend running

#### ESP32 Configuration

You should have Arduino IDE Installed

  1.  Add ESP32 Board to your Arduino IDE
    1. In your Arduino IDE, go to File> Preferences
        Installing ESP32 Add-on in Arduino IDE Windows, Mac OS X, Linux open preferences
    2. Enter ```https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json``` 
        into the ‚ÄúAdditional Board Manager URLs‚Äù field then, click the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù button:
    Note: if you already have the ESP32 boards URL, you can separate the URLs with a comma as follows:
    ```https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json,
      http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json```
    1. Open the Boards Manager. Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager‚Ä¶
    2. Search for ESP32 and press install button for the ESP32 by Espressif Systems‚Äú:
    3. That‚Äôs it. It should be installed after a few seconds.

  2.  Now copy the contents of the libs folder to the libraries directory of your Arduino
    4. If you are using windows, the libraries directory will be Documents/Arduino/libraries

##### ESP32 Node FW Uploading
  1.  Select ESP32 Dev Module from Tools->Board->ESP32
  2.  Select the correct port from Tools->Port
  3.  Then open ESP32Firmware.ino file, and open WiFiCreds.h tab on line number 4 and 5, put your WiFi creds
  4.  Upload the Code to your ESP32 Wrover Module Gateway Board




## üéà PythonScript Configuration <a name="pythonscript"></a>

1.  Download and install Python3 from official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2.  Go in the PythonScript folder and open the terminal
3.  Execute ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
### Python Script running

- Run the python script using ```python3 Script.py```
- The script will start running, you can enter the color and the values which will be instantly sent to the ESP32 and the ESP32 will send back the response.
